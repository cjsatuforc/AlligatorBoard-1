The Latest Generation Electronic for RepRap 3D printer

The Alligator Board is designed to be a complete and reliable solution as RepRap 3D printer 
electronic control board. The base module features everything you need to build a standard 3D printer, 
and with the expansion piggy this is the most complete solution for complex 3D printer.

It is based on the 32 bit Cortex M3 ATSAM3X8EA-AU microcontroller (Arduino-Due-Compatible). 
This represents a big step forward towards greater computing power, compared to the existing 
solution based on 8 bit mcu. This means that this product is well suited for any kind of 3D printer, 
and is the ideal solution for Delta models, which require more complex calculus 
for its coordinates resolution. 

The professional design of every part takes care of the needs of the most exigent makers, 
ensuring best performances in your application.
